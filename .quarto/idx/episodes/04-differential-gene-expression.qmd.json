After the previous section, we now have a count table with the number of reads that map to each gene in each sample. How do we get to our goal from this table? We will need to use statistical models! In this section, we will use the `DESeq2` package in `R` for differential gene expression analysis. Several other packages with different statistical models and assumptions exist (e.g. `EdgeR` and `Limma`): we pick `DESeq2` because it is robust, widely-used, and user friendly.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we will explore the transcriptomes of *A. thaliana* plants that experienced microgravity by growing on the International Space Station, while control plants were grown on earth. The experimental design is simple: there are three replicates in both conditions `space_flight` and `ground_control`.\n\nFirst we will load the packages that we need, and then load the count table and metadata file.\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\n#| warning: false\nset.seed(1992)\n\nlibrary(DESeq2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n```\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\nraw_counts <- read.csv(\"../data/GLDS38_raw_counts.csv\", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F) # <1>\n\nraw_counts <- raw_counts %>% column_to_rownames(\"gene\") # <2>\n\nmetadata <- read.csv(\"../data/samples_to_condition.csv\", header = T)\n\nraw_counts[1:4,1:4]\n```\n1. Make sure you use the correct path to where your data is stored. Depending on your folder structure, you may not need the `../` and you could use `data/GLDS38_raw_counts.csv` instead.\n2. Here, we store the column `gene` as row names instead of a dedicated column.\n\nThat looks good! Now, it's important to note that `DESeq2` expects the sample names (columns in count table) to *exactly match* the sample names in the metadata file, and be in the *same order*! For this small dataset, we can inspect that by eye. In addition, and probably useful for larger datasets, we can use the `all()` function to check this.\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\nhead(metadata)\n```\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\nall(colnames(raw_counts) == metadata$sample) # <1>\n```\n1. If this does not return `TRUE`, you need to reorder or rename sample names in one of your files. \n\n### Creating the `dds` object\n\nWe are now ready to create a `DESeqDataSet` object, commonly abbreviated as `dds`. The `dds` object will contain our count tables and metadata, but later, also the normalized counts and differentially expressed gene lists. As such, the `dds` objects help us keep things neat in our RStudio session. To make one, we need to specify our experimental design 'formula'. In this tutorial, there's only one variable: the design formula will be as simple as `~ condition`. However, in multi-factor experiments it can include additional variables, can also include unwanted sources of variation such as RNA isolation batch, the researcher who extracted RNA, or on which table the plants were grown. Including these factors in the design formula will help DESeq2 to account for these soures of variation, allowing more accurate estimation of the primary conditionâ€™s effect. For example, in an experiment with a potential batch effect, treatments, and different genotypes: `~ batch + treatment + genotype`. If you also want to model the *interaction*, that is  whether the treatment effect varies by genotype, change the `+` to a `*`: `~ batch + treatment * genotype`.\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\ndds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = raw_counts, \n                              colData = metadata, \n                              design = ~ condition)\n```\n\n## Assesing the quality of an RNA-seq experiment via PCA\n\nAs essential step in RNA-seq analysis is to inspect similarity between samples. In particular, we should confirm that **replicates with the same treatment are similar to each other**, and make sure that **the experimental condition is the major source of variation in the data**. In addition, these quality-control explorations will also help identify if any samples behalve as outliers, or whether there may have been a sample swap. We will use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to do this. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms complex high-dimensional data (like expression of thousands of genes) into a limited number of new variables ('principal components') that capture the most variation in the dataset. \n\n### Performing variance stabilization\n\nBefore performing the PCA itself, we need to take an import feature of RNA-seq data into account: the variance of a gene is strongly correlated to the expression level of the gene. In statistics language, our data is **not homoscedastic**, while PCA assumes homoscedastic data. We can solve this by performing a variance stabilizing transformation `vst()`:\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\nvariance_stabilized_dataset <- vst(dds, blind = TRUE)\n```\n\nLet's inspect the average expression and standard deviation of each gene to show that this transformation worked. In the following plots, each dot represents one *A. thaliana* gene:\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show the code to make the plots\"\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nwithout_vst <- raw_counts %>% \n    as.data.frame() %>% \n    rownames_to_column(\"gene\") %>% \n    pivot_longer(cols = - gene, names_to = \"sample\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n    group_by(gene) %>% \n    summarise(gene_mean = mean(count), gene_sd = sd(count)) %>% \n    ungroup() %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = log10(gene_mean), y = log10(gene_sd))) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n    labs(x = \"Gene count average\\n(log10 scale)\",\n        y = \"Gene count standard deviation\\n(log10 scale)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"No variance stabilization\")\n    \nvariance_stabilised_counts <- assay(variance_stabilized_dataset)\n\nwith_vst <- variance_stabilised_counts %>% \n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = - gene, names_to = \"sample\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n  group_by(gene) %>% \n  summarise(gene_mean = mean(count), gene_sd = sd(count)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = log10(gene_mean), y = log10(gene_sd))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(x = \"Gene count average\\n(log10 scale)\",\n       y = \"Gene count standard deviation\\n(log10 scale)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Variance stabilized\")\n\nwithout_vst | with_vst\n\nvariance_stabilised_counts_df <- variance_stabilised_counts %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\")  \nwrite.csv(variance_stabilised_counts_df, \"../data_processed/variance_stabilized_dataset.csv\", row.names=FALSE)\n```\nIndeed, we can observe that genes that are highly expressed (have high mean count) also have a high standard deviation. This correlation is no longer there after stabilizing the variance.\n\n### Performing the PCA\n\nOkay, finally we are ready to perform the PCA. `DESeq2` makes this very easy for us with a simple function, `plotPCA()`, which directly gives us a PCA plot. \n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\nplotPCA(variance_stabilized_dataset)\n```\n\nLet's break this plot down:\n\n- We see that principal component 1 (`PC1`) explains 60% of the variance, while `PC2` explains 29%. Those are nice scores. However, `PC1` does not seem to separate our two conditions. This means that there's another source of variation in this dataset that we are seemingly unaware of.\n- We see that `PC2` nicely separates our two conditions. This is good!  \n- We see that two samples from `space_flight` cluster very closely together, while one sample is quite a distant from those two. This means that this one replicate behaves a bit differently than the rest. However, since it's still similar to the other two samples on the `PC2` axis, this does not worry me.\n\nIf you want to have full control and make the PCA plot yourself in `ggplot`, you can add `returnData=TRUE)`\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\n#| eval: false\npca_data <- plotPCA(variance_stabilized_dataset, returnData=TRUE) \n```\n\nWhile it is impossible to give examples of all situations that can occur in PCAs, we highlight a few below in fake PCA plots:\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show the code to make the plots\"\n\ndf_swap <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 1, sd = 0.2),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = -2, sd = 0.2)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0.4, sd = 0.2),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0.3, sd = 0.2)),\n  genotype = c(rep(\"WT\", 4), \"mutant\", rep(\"mutant\", 4), \"WT\"))\n\ndf_weak_sep <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0.2, sd = 0.45),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.6)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)),\n  genotype = rep(c(\"WT\", \"mutant\"), each = 5)\n)\n\np1 <- df_swap %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Sample swap\")\n\np2 <- df_weak_sep %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n    xlab(\"PC1 (12%)\") +\n    ylab(\"PC2 (4%)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Weak separation\")\n\np1 | p2\n```\n\nIn the first plot, we see one WT sample clustering with mutant samples, and vice versa. This is a clear indication that two samples were swapped somewhere in the process: during sampling, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, library prep, or in the metadata file. If you can trace this back in your labjournal, you could swap the sample label back. If not... it's probably better to discard these two samples completely. In the second plot, we can see that there's no clear separation between WT and mutant samples. In addition, the two PCs explain little of the variance present in the dataset. This is an indication that the genotype actually has little impact on the transcriptome. While worrying, this does not mean that all is lost! You can still proceed to differential expression analysis, maybe the difference between the two genotypes is quite subtle. \n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show the code to make the plots\"\ndf_confounding_1 <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 1, sd = 0.45),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = -1, sd = 0.6)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)),\n  genotype = rep(c(\"WT\", \"mutant\"), each = 5),\n  gender = rep(c(\"male\", \"female\"), each = 5)\n)\n\np1 <- df_confounding_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Genotype effect ...\")\n\np2 <- df_confounding_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = gender)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"... or gender effect?\")\n\np1 | p2\n```\n\nIn this example, we see separation of our wildtype and mutant samples. Experiment succesful! ... or is it? Upon closer inpection, we can see that gender of our samples also separates our samples in the same way. It turns out that all wildtypes were male mice, and all mutants were female. We will therefore never know if differentially expressed genes are caused by the genotype, or simply by the gender of the mice: a clear case of confounding variable. This is an experimental design flaw, and should have been caught before sampling. Yet, it happens!\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\" icon=\"false\"}\nBesides PCA, how else could you assess whether replicate samples from the same treatment show similar results?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\nWe can use a correlation analysis to do this. For this analysis, we will also need the variance stabilized counts.\n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\nlibrary(pheatmap)\n\ncorrelation_matrix <- cor(variance_stabilised_counts)\n\nmetadata_2 <- metadata %>% column_to_rownames(\"sample_name\")\n\npheatmap(correlation_matrix, annotation_row = metadata_2, \n         clustering_distance_rows = \"correlation\", \n         clustering_distance_cols = \"correlation\", \n         display_numbers = TRUE, fontsize = 7)\n```\nWe can see that all the `ground_control` and `space_flight` samples cluster together. For example, `ground_control` samples have a 0.98 or greater correlation with each other, while they have a slightly lower correlation with `space_flight` samples. However, the samples still have a high correlation also accross the different treatment. This shows that the transcriptomes are actually highly similar, regardless of treatment, probably because the majority of genes is not differentially expressed. \n:::\n\n## Differential gene expression analysis\n\n`DESeq2` handles all steps of DEG analysis, from sample normalization to the statistical models and tests in one function. Easy! We run this function with the `dds` object as input, while storing the output in the `dds` object as well. In this way, we will 'fill' the `dds` object with the new analysis. `R` will now print all the individual steps that the `DESeq()` function performed for us. \n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\ndds <- DESeq(dds)\n```\n\n**TODO:** \n\n- show plot of normalization effect\n- Write scaled counts to file\n\n### Lists of DEGs\n\nNow, to extract the list of DEGs from the `dds` we run another line of code. The argument `alpha` is used to specify the *p*-value cutoff for significance, the default value is `alpha = 0.1`. We will use 0.05 here. We will also sort the table on *p*-value:\n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\nres <- results(dds, alpha = 0.05) # <1>\n\nDEGs <- res %>%    # <2>\n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"genes\") %>%\n  mutate(minus_log10_pvalue = -log10(padj)) %>% \n  arrange(padj) \n\nhead(DEGs) \n\nwrite.csv(DEGs, '../data_processed/all_genes_spaceflight_vs_ground.csv', quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE) # <3>\n```\n1. Generate results table\n2. Turn results table into a data frame, generate a `genes` column from the rownames, make a new column with `-log10` transformed p-values, then sort by adjusted p-value.\n3. Write to a file!\n\n**TODO**: \n\n- Explain the DEGs dataframe, what is base mean, what is log2 fold change?\n- Look at DESeq2 shrinkage of fold changes\n- Add piece on extra contrasts\n\n### Volcano plots\n\nOne way to visualize DEG results is to display them in a Volcano plot. Such a plot shows a measure of effect size (log2 fold changes) versus a measure of significance. There are [tools available](https://goedhart.shinyapps.io/VolcaNoseR/) (developed by Joachim Goedhart, assistant professor at SILS) to help you make such a plot using the DEG list we just saved as a `.csv` file. Alternatively, we can make one ourselves for full control of the plot:\n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\n# Define fold change and p-value cutoffs\nlfc_cutoff <- 1.5\npadj_cutoff <- 0.05\n\n# Make new categorical variable containing significance information\nDEGs <- DEGs %>% \n        mutate(significance = case_when(\n          padj < padj_cutoff & log2FoldChange > lfc_cutoff ~ 'Significantly upregulated',\n          padj < padj_cutoff & log2FoldChange < -lfc_cutoff ~ 'Significantly downregulated',\n          padj < padj_cutoff ~ 'Significant but small effect size',\n          TRUE ~ 'Not significant'\n        ))\n\nDEGs_subset <- DEGs %>% filter(significance == \"Significantly upregulated\" | significance == \"Significantly downregulated\")\nwrite.csv(DEGs_subset, '../data_processed/DEGs_spaceflight_vs_ground.csv', quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)\n\ncolors <- c(\"Significantly upregulated\"=\"#E69F00\", \"Significantly downregulated\"=\"#56B4E9\", \"Not significant\"=\"gray80\", \"Significant but small effect size\" = 'grey50')\n\n# select top 10 genes to highlight\ntop_genes <- DEGs[1:10, ]\n\nvolcano <- DEGs %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj), colour = significance)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 0.8) + \n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = -log10(padj_cutoff)), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lfc_cutoff), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = -lfc_cutoff), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(data = top_genes, shape = 21,fill = NA, color = \"black\") +  # Highlight top10\n  geom_text_repel(data = top_genes, aes(label = genes), size = 2, min.segment.length = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=colors) +\n  xlim(c(-10,10)) +\n  theme_bw() \n\nggsave(\"volcano_plot.png\", volcano, width = 14, height = 8, units = \"cm\")\nvolcano \n```\nWe can plot the DESeq2-normalized counts of two genes, just to confirm whether the volcano plot is correct. We pick one that is highly upregulated in `space_flight`conditions (AT5G04120), and one that is strongly downregulated (AT1G62280). \n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\n#| fig-width: 4\n#| fig-height: 2\ngene_1 <- plotCounts(dds, gene=\"AT5G04120\", intgroup=\"condition\", \n                returnData=TRUE)\n\ngene_2 <- plotCounts(dds, gene=\"AT1G62280\", intgroup=\"condition\", \n                        returnData=TRUE)\n\ngene_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = count, colour = condition)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.05) +\n  theme_bw()\ngene_2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = count, colour = condition)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.05) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\nYep, that seems about right.\n\n### What's next\n\nIn the next section, we will display the same data in a heatmap, another popular plot of choice for RNA-seq experiments. In addition, we will look into charactering the molecular functions of up- and down-regulated genes using GO term enrichment.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThe main goal of most RNA-seq experiments is to discover which genes are differentially expressed between different groups (treatments, tissues, genotypes): the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

However, since it's still similar to the other two samples on the `PC2` axis, this does not worry me.\n\nIf you want to have full control and make the PCA plot yourself in `ggplot`, you can add `returnData=TRUE)`\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\n#| eval: false\npca_data <- plotPCA(variance_stabilized_dataset, returnData=TRUE) \n```\n\nWhile it is impossible to give examples of all situations that can occur in PCAs, we highlight a few below in fake PCA plots:\n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show the code to make the plots\"\n\ndf_swap <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 1, sd = 0.2),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = -2, sd = 0.2)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0.4, sd = 0.2),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0.3, sd = 0.2)),\n  genotype = c(rep(\"WT\", 4), \"mutant\", rep(\"mutant\", 4), \"WT\"))\n\ndf_weak_sep <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0.2, sd = 0.45),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.6)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)),\n  genotype = rep(c(\"WT\", \"mutant\"), each = 5)\n)\n\np1 <- df_swap %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Sample swap\")\n\np2 <- df_weak_sep %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n    xlab(\"PC1 (12%)\") +\n    ylab(\"PC2 (4%)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Weak separation\")\n\np1 | p2\n```\n\nIn the first plot, we see one WT sample clustering with mutant samples, and vice versa. This is a clear indication that two samples were swapped somewhere in the process: during sampling, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, library prep, or in the metadata file. If you can trace this back in your labjournal, you could swap the sample label back. If not... it's probably better to discard these two samples completely. In the second plot, we can see that there's no clear separation between WT and mutant samples. In addition, the two PCs explain little of the variance present in the dataset. This is an indication that the genotype actually has little impact on the transcriptome. While worrying, this does not mean that all is lost! You can still proceed to differential expression analysis, maybe the difference between the two genotypes is quite subtle. \n\n```{R filename = \"R\"}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show the code to make the plots\"\ndf_confounding_1 <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 1, sd = 0.45),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = -1, sd = 0.6)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)),\n  genotype = rep(c(\"WT\", \"mutant\"), each = 5),\n  gender = rep(c(\"male\", \"female\"), each = 5)\n)\n\np1 <- df_confounding_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Genotype effect ...\")\n\np2 <- df_confounding_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = gender)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"... or gender effect?\")\n\np1 | p2\n```\n\nIn this example, we see separation of our wildtype and mutant samples. Experiment succesful! ... or is it? Upon closer inpection, we can see that gender of our samples also separates our samples in the same way. It turns out that all wildtypes were male mice, and all mutants were female. We will therefore never know if differentially expressed genes are caused by the genotype, or simply by the gender of the mice: a clear case of confounding variable. This is an experimental design flaw, and should have been caught before sampling. Yet, it happens!\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\" icon=\"false\"}\nBesides PCA, how else could you assess whether replicate samples from the same treatment show similar results?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\nWe can use a correlation analysis to do this. For this analysis, we will also need the variance stabilized counts.\n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\nlibrary(pheatmap)\n\ncorrelation_matrix <- cor(variance_stabilised_counts)\n\nmetadata_2 <- metadata %>% column_to_rownames(\"sample_name\")\n\npheatmap(correlation_matrix, annotation_row = metadata_2, \n         clustering_distance_rows = \"correlation\", \n         clustering_distance_cols = \"correlation\", \n         display_numbers = TRUE, fontsize = 7)\n```\nWe can see that all the `ground_control` and `space_flight` samples cluster together. For example, `ground_control` samples have a 0.98 or greater correlation with each other, while they have a slightly lower correlation with `space_flight` samples. However, the samples still have a high correlation also accross the different treatment. This shows that the transcriptomes are actually highly similar, regardless of treatment, probably because the majority of genes is not differentially expressed. \n:::\n\n## Differential gene expression analysis\n\n`DESeq2` handles all steps of DEG analysis, from sample normalization to the statistical models and tests in one function. Easy! We run this function with the `dds` object as input, while storing the output in the `dds` object as well. In this way, we will 'fill' the `dds` object with the new analysis. `R` will now print all the individual steps that the `DESeq()` function performed for us. \n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\ndds <- DESeq(dds)\n```\n\n**TODO:** \n\n- show plot of normalization effect\n- Write scaled counts to file\n\n### Lists of DEGs\n\nNow, to extract the list of DEGs from the `dds` we run another line of code. The argument `alpha` is used to specify the *p*-value cutoff for significance, the default value is `alpha = 0.1`. We will use 0.05 here. We will also sort the table on *p*-value:\n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\nres <- results(dds, alpha = 0.05) # <1>\n\nDEGs <- res %>%    # <2>\n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"genes\") %>%\n  mutate(minus_log10_pvalue = -log10(padj)) %>% \n  arrange(padj) \n\nhead(DEGs) \n\nwrite.csv(DEGs, '../data_processed/all_genes_spaceflight_vs_ground.csv', quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE) # <3>\n```\n1. Generate results table\n2. Turn results table into a data frame, generate a `genes` column from the rownames, make a new column with `-log10` transformed p-values, then sort by adjusted p-value.\n3. Write to a file!\n\n**TODO**: \n\n- Explain the DEGs dataframe, what is base mean, what is log2 fold change?\n- Look at DESeq2 shrinkage of fold changes\n- Add piece on extra contrasts\n\n### Volcano plots\n\nOne way to visualize DEG results is to display them in a Volcano plot. Such a plot shows a measure of effect size (log2 fold changes) versus a measure of significance. There are [tools available](https://goedhart.shinyapps.io/VolcaNoseR/) (developed by Joachim Goedhart, assistant professor at SILS) to help you make such a plot using the DEG list we just saved as a `.csv` file. Alternatively, we can make one ourselves for full control of the plot:\n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\n# Define fold change and p-value cutoffs\nlfc_cutoff <- 1.5\npadj_cutoff <- 0.05\n\n# Make new categorical variable containing significance information\nDEGs <- DEGs %>% \n        mutate(significance = case_when(\n          padj < padj_cutoff & log2FoldChange > lfc_cutoff ~ 'Significantly upregulated',\n          padj < padj_cutoff & log2FoldChange < -lfc_cutoff ~ 'Significantly downregulated',\n          padj < padj_cutoff ~ 'Significant but small effect size',\n          TRUE ~ 'Not significant'\n        ))\n\nDEGs_subset <- DEGs %>% filter(significance == \"Significantly upregulated\" | significance == \"Significantly downregulated\")\nwrite.csv(DEGs_subset, '../data_processed/DEGs_spaceflight_vs_ground.csv', quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)\n\ncolors <- c(\"Significantly upregulated\"=\"#E69F00\", \"Significantly downregulated\"=\"#56B4E9\", \"Not significant\"=\"gray80\", \"Significant but small effect size\" = 'grey50')\n\n# select top 10 genes to highlight\ntop_genes <- DEGs[1:10, ]\n\nvolcano <- DEGs %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj), colour = significance)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 0.8) + \n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = -log10(padj_cutoff)), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lfc_cutoff), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = -lfc_cutoff), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(data = top_genes, shape = 21,fill = NA, color = \"black\") +  # Highlight top10\n  geom_text_repel(data = top_genes, aes(label = genes), size = 2, min.segment.length = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=colors) +\n  xlim(c(-10,10)) +\n  theme_bw() \n\nggsave(\"volcano_plot.png\", volcano, width = 14, height = 8, units = \"cm\")\nvolcano \n```\nWe can plot the DESeq2-normalized counts of two genes, just to confirm whether the volcano plot is correct. We pick one that is highly upregulated in `space_flight`conditions (AT5G04120), and one that is strongly downregulated (AT1G62280). \n\n```{R filename=\"R\"}\n#| fig-width: 4\n#| fig-height: 2\ngene_1 <- plotCounts(dds, gene=\"AT5G04120\", intgroup=\"condition\", \n                returnData=TRUE)\n\ngene_2 <- plotCounts(dds, gene=\"AT1G62280\", intgroup=\"condition\", \n                        returnData=TRUE)\n\ngene_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = count, colour = condition)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.05) +\n  theme_bw()\ngene_2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = count, colour = condition)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.05) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\nYep, that seems about right.\n\n### What's next\n\nIn the next section, we will display the same data in a heatmap, another popular plot of choice for RNA-seq experiments. In addition, we will look into charactering the molecular functions of up- and down-regulated genes using GO term
