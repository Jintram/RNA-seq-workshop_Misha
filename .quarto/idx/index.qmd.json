This workshop will introduce you to the basics of gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq. It is going to be fun and empowering!

Through careful experimental design, this gene expression information can answer research questions and offer biological insights.\n\nThe workshop consists of two core parts: \n\n1. **Bioinformatics:** Quality control of the reads, mapping reads to a reference genome, and count the number of reads per gene. This will give us a count table!\n2. **Differential gene expression:** We will use DESeq2 to discover differentially expressed genes in certain conditions. DESeq2 will use your count table as input.\n\nThe materials on this website are meant to be discussed in two four-hour trainer-led workshop sessions.
