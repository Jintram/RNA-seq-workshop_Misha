Might be pretty useful, but it's also yet more content.\n- I made a little overview of how often different DEG analysis packages are cited last year; but don't think that's very valuable to add here.\n- Add links to reading materials?\n    - https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#theory\n\t- https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/html/rnaseqGene.html\n\t\t- (More accessible, according to Love.)\n\n:::\n\nThe main goal of most RNA-seq experiments is to discover which genes are differentially expressed between \ndifferent groups (treatments, tissues, genotypes): the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). \nAfter the previous section, we now have a count table with the number of reads that map to each gene in each sample. \nHow do we get to our goal from this table? We will need to use statistical models! In this section, \nwe will use the `DESeq2` package in `R` for differential gene expression analysis. \nSeveral other packages with different statistical models and assumptions exist (e.g. `EdgeR` and `Limma`): \nwe pick `DESeq2` because it is robust, widely-used, and user friendly <mwadd>[cite Li2022, others?]</mwadd>.\n\n## Reading the count table into DESeq2\n\nIn this tutorial, we will explore the transcriptomes of *A. thaliana* plants that experienced microgravity by growing on the International Space Station, while control plants were grown on earth. The experimental design is simple: there are three replicates in both conditions `space_flight` and `ground_control`.\n\nFirst we will load the packages that we need, and then load the count table and metadata file.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1992) # some parts of analysis depend on random sampling or initialization; \n               # setting seed sets constant array of random numbers, ensuring reproducibility.\n               # this won't affect main results too much, but is thorough\n\nlibrary(DESeq2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<mwadd>(added comment above)</mwadd>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nraw_counts <- read.csv(\"../data/GLDS38_raw_counts.csv\", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F) # <1>\n\nraw_counts <- raw_counts %>% column_to_rownames(\"gene\") # <2>\n\nmetadata <- read.csv(\"../data/samples_to_condition.csv\", header = T)\n\nraw_counts[1:4,1:4]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_FLT_Rep1_G1S1 Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_FLT_Rep2_G1S2\nAT1G01010                            339                            383\nAT1G01020                            126                            117\nAT1G01030                            153                            158\nAT1G01040                           1238                            442\n          Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_FLT_Rep3_G1S3 Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_GC_Rep1_G2S1\nAT1G01010                            363                           650\nAT1G01020                             89                            60\nAT1G01030                            143                            97\nAT1G01040                            543                           783\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n1. Make sure you use the correct path to where your data is stored. Depending on your folder structure, you may not need the `../` and you could use `data/GLDS38_raw_counts.csv` instead.\n2. Here, we store the column `gene` as row names instead of a dedicated column.\n\nThat looks good! Now, it's important to note that `DESeq2` expects the sample names (columns in count table) to *exactly match* the sample names in the metadata file, and be in the *same order*! For this small dataset, we can inspect that by eye. In addition, and probably useful for larger datasets, we can use the `all()` function to check this.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(metadata)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                     sample_name      condition\n1 Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_FLT_Rep1_G1S1   space_flight\n2 Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_FLT_Rep2_G1S2   space_flight\n3 Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_FLT_Rep3_G1S3   space_flight\n4  Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_GC_Rep1_G2S1 ground_control\n5  Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_GC_Rep2_G2S2 ground_control\n6  Atha_WT_Col_0_sl_GC_Rep3_G2S3 ground_control\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall(colnames(raw_counts) == metadata$sample) # <1>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n1. If this does not return `TRUE`, you need to reorder or rename sample names in one of your files. \n\n### Creating the `dds` object\n\n<mwadd>I edited the section below</mwadd>\n\nWe are now ready to create a `DESeqDataSet` object, commonly abbreviated as `dds`. \n<!--The `dds` object will contain our count tables and metadata, but later, also the normalized counts \nand differentially expressed gene lists.-->\nWe will put our count tables and metadata in this object, and use it as input for the DESeq2 functions.\nDESeq2 functions will return this same object again, with added information such as normalized counts and differentially expressed genes.\n\n<!--As such, the `dds` objects help us keep things neat in our RStudio session.-->\nStoring all this related information in the one `dds` object helps keeps our R session clean.\n\nTo make one, we need to specify \nour experimental design 'formula'. In this tutorial, there's only one variable (*condition*): the design formula will \nbe as simple as `~ condition`. However, in multi-factor experiments it can include additional variables, \ncan also include unwanted sources of variation such as RNA isolation batch, the researcher who extracted RNA, \nor on which table the plants were grown. Including these factors in the design formula will help DESeq2 to \naccount for these soures of variation, allowing more accurate estimation of the primary condition’s effect. \nFor example, in an experiment with a potential batch effect, treatments, and different genotypes: `~ batch + treatment + genotype`. \nThis notation is shorthand to tell DESeq2 that the final gene expression in each sample $y$ should be modelled as:\n$$\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_\\text{batch} + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_\\text{treatment} + \\beta_3 \\cdot x_\\text{genotype} + \\epsilon\n$$\nwhere $x_{...}$ is either one or zero depending on if the condition applies or not, and $\\beta_i$ are constants that need to be fitted.\n(Don't worry about the $\\epsilon$, this is a technical way to express that the model is not perfect and there will always be some noise in the data.)\n<mwadd>Risk of adding this is that's it's \"scary math\", but otherwise I think the design formulae remain very mysterious. \nWe could add example.</mwadd>\n\nIf you also want to model the *interaction*, that is  whether the treatment effect varies by genotype, \nchange the `+` to a `*`: `~ batch + treatment * genotype`. (Separate *treatment* and *genotype* terms will \nautomatically be included in the model when using `*`.)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = raw_counts, \n                              colData = metadata, \n                              design = ~ condition)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in DESeqDataSet(se, design = design, ignoreRank): some variables in\ndesign formula are characters, converting to factors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<!--## Assesing the quality of an RNA-seq experiment via PCA-->\n## A preliminary assessment of your data using PCA\n\n<mwadd>(Changed title, as I think QC is put too strong.)</mwadd>\n\n<mwadd>I think this is a very clear text concisely explaining PCA. I understand it very well, but \nI'm wondering though whether for novices it might be nice to add some more \"explain it to me like I'm 5 years\nold language\" (exaggerated). Tried adding some some sentences and a graph.</mwadd>\n\nAs essential step in RNA-seq analysis is to inspect similarity between samples. In particular, \nwe should confirm that **replicates with the same treatment are similar to each other**, and \nmake sure that **the experimental condition is the major source of variation in the data**. \nIn addition, these quality-control explorations will also help identify if any samples behalve as outliers, \nor whether there may have been a sample swap. \n\nIt would be very nice if there was a visualization from which we can see how samples relate to each other.\nFor example an $x, y$ plot in which the distance between indicates their similarity.\n\n![A visual comparison between sample similarity.](../images/Illustration_dimensionality_reduction.png){fig-alt=\"dimensionality reduction plot\" width=20% style=\"background:#fff; float:left; margin-right:1em;\"}\n\nThis exists!\nWe will use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to do this. \nPCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms complex high-dimensional data (like expression of thousands of genes) \ninto a limited number of new variables ('principal components') that capture the most variation in the dataset. \n\n\n\n### Performing variance stabilization\n\nBefore performing the PCA itself, we need to take an import feature of RNA-seq data into account: the variance of a gene is strongly correlated to the expression level of the gene. In statistics language, our data is **not homoscedastic**, while PCA assumes homoscedastic data. We can solve this by performing a variance stabilizing transformation `vst()`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvariance_stabilized_dataset <- vst(dds, blind = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLet's inspect the average expression and standard deviation of each gene to show that this transformation worked. In the following plots, each dot represents one *A. thaliana* gene:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code to make the plots\"}\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nwithout_vst <- raw_counts %>% \n    as.data.frame() %>% \n    rownames_to_column(\"gene\") %>% \n    pivot_longer(cols = - gene, names_to = \"sample\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n    group_by(gene) %>% \n    summarise(gene_mean = mean(count), gene_sd = sd(count)) %>% \n    ungroup() %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = log10(gene_mean), y = log10(gene_sd))) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n    labs(x = \"Gene count average\\n(log10 scale)\",\n        y = \"Gene count standard deviation\\n(log10 scale)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"No variance stabilization\")\n    \nvariance_stabilised_counts <- assay(variance_stabilized_dataset)\n\nwith_vst <- variance_stabilised_counts %>% \n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = - gene, names_to = \"sample\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n  group_by(gene) %>% \n  summarise(gene_mean = mean(count), gene_sd = sd(count)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = log10(gene_mean), y = log10(gene_sd))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(x = \"Gene count average\\n(log10 scale)\",\n       y = \"Gene count standard deviation\\n(log10 scale)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Variance stabilized\")\n\nwithout_vst | with_vst\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-differential-gene-expression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code to make the plots\"}\nvariance_stabilised_counts_df <- variance_stabilised_counts %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\")  \nwrite.csv(variance_stabilised_counts_df, \"../data_processed/variance_stabilized_dataset.csv\", row.names=FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIndeed, we can observe that genes that are highly expressed (have high mean count) also have a high standard deviation. This correlation is no longer there after stabilizing the variance.\n\n### Performing the PCA\n\n<mwadd>I think we'll need to explain what we're doing and seeing a bit more in this section. I made some edits.</mwadd>\n\nOkay, finally we are ready to perform the PCA. `DESeq2` makes this very easy for us with a simple function, \n`plotPCA()`, which directly gives us a PCA plot. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplotPCA(variance_stabilized_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-differential-gene-expression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Understanding the PCA plot\n\nWhat do we see here? Dots correspond to samples, and the distance between points corresponds to gene expression similarity. \n\nThe x and y axis correspond to PC1 and PC2, PC standing for \"principal component\". \nWe won't go into the details of PCA here, but will try to briefly explain what is plotted here.\nWe could have selected two arbitrary genes and put those x and y axis, which would also produced a similar plot. \nBut we can choose from many genes to do this, and we don't know which ones relate to relevant changes.\nInstead, PCA formulates \"principal components\" (there are actually many more than PC1 and PC2, there's also PC3, PC4, et cetera).\nWhen moving a step along a PC axis, this is related to specific changes *in all genes*.\nThe PCs are chosen such, that most gene expression variance seen between the samples can be described by taking steps along PC1. \nVariance that couldn't be captured in PC1, ie because it is of a different kind, is described by PC2, or PC3, et cetera.\n\n#### Interpretation\n\nSo what can we learn from the PCA plot?\n\n- We see that principal component 1 (`PC1`) explains 60% of the variance, while `PC2` explains 29%. Those are nice scores. However, `PC1` does not seem to separate our two conditions. This means that there's another source of variation in this dataset that we are seemingly unaware of.\n- We see that `PC2` nicely separates our two conditions. This is good!  \n- We see that two samples from `space_flight` cluster very closely together, while one sample is quite a distant from those two. This means that this one replicate behaves a bit differently than the rest. However, since it's still similar to the other two samples on the `PC2` axis, this does not worry me.\n\n#### Refining the PCA analysis plot\n\nIf you want to have full control and make the PCA plot yourself in `ggplot`, you can add `returnData=TRUE)`\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npca_data <- plotPCA(variance_stabilized_dataset, returnData=TRUE) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is impossible to give examples of all situations that can occur in PCAs, we highlight a few below in fake PCA plots:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code to make the plots\"}\ndf_swap <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 1, sd = 0.2),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = -2, sd = 0.2)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0.4, sd = 0.2),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0.3, sd = 0.2)),\n  genotype = c(rep(\"WT\", 4), \"mutant\", rep(\"mutant\", 4), \"WT\"))\n\ndf_weak_sep <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0.2, sd = 0.45),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.6)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)),\n  genotype = rep(c(\"WT\", \"mutant\"), each = 5)\n)\n\np1 <- df_swap %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Sample swap\")\n\np2 <- df_weak_sep %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n    xlab(\"PC1 (12%)\") +\n    ylab(\"PC2 (4%)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Weak separation\")\n\np1 | p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-differential-gene-expression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn the first plot, we see one WT sample clustering with mutant samples, and vice versa. This is a clear indication that two samples were swapped somewhere in the process: during sampling, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, library prep, or in the metadata file. If you can trace this back in your labjournal, you could swap the sample label back. If not... it's probably better to discard these two samples completely. In the second plot, we can see that there's no clear separation between WT and mutant samples. In addition, the two PCs explain little of the variance present in the dataset. This is an indication that the genotype actually has little impact on the transcriptome. While worrying, this does not mean that all is lost! You can still proceed to differential expression analysis, maybe the difference between the two genotypes is quite subtle. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code to make the plots\"}\ndf_confounding_1 <- data.frame(\n  PC1 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 1, sd = 0.45),   \n          rnorm(5, mean = -1, sd = 0.6)), \n  PC2 = c(rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25),\n          rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)),\n  genotype = rep(c(\"WT\", \"mutant\"), each = 5),\n  gender = rep(c(\"male\", \"female\"), each = 5)\n)\n\np1 <- df_confounding_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = genotype)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Genotype effect ...\")\n\np2 <- df_confounding_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = gender)) + geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"PC1 (48%)\") +\n  ylab(\"PC2 (13%)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"... or gender effect?\")\n\np1 | p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-differential-gene-expression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we see separation of our wildtype and mutant samples.

It turns out that all wildtypes were male mice, and all mutants were female. We will therefore never know if differentially expressed genes are caused by the genotype, or simply by the gender of the mice: a clear case of confounding variable.

We will also sort the table on *p*-value:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nres <- results(dds, alpha = 0.05) # <1>\n\nDEGs <- res %>%    # <2>\n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"genes\") %>%\n  mutate(minus_log10_pvalue = -log10(padj)) %>% \n  arrange(padj) \n\nhead(DEGs) \n\nwrite.csv(DEGs, '../data_processed/all_genes_spaceflight_vs_ground.csv', quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE) # <3>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      genes  baseMean log2FoldChange     lfcSE      stat       pvalue\n1 AT5G04120  456.5672       3.626601 0.2462679  14.72625 4.373302e-49\n2 AT2G28780 1964.3983      -3.630964 0.3295515 -11.01790 3.132877e-28\n3 AT1G62280  217.8345      -3.901515 0.3558773 -10.96309 5.750122e-28\n4 AT1G32450 5241.0272      -3.468312 0.3201047 -10.83493 2.351468e-27\n5 AT1G30530  708.2953       2.033682 0.1938998  10.48832 9.775358e-26\n6 AT1G15380  739.4577      -2.714855 0.2601613 -10.43528 1.711141e-25\n          padj minus_log10_pvalue\n1 9.870980e-45           44.00564\n2 3.535609e-24           23.45154\n3 4.326200e-24           23.36389\n4 1.326874e-23           22.87717\n5 4.412792e-22           21.35529\n6 6.437029e-22           21.19131\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n1.

Such a plot shows a measure of effect size (log2 fold changes) versus a measure of significance. There are [tools available](https://goedhart.shinyapps.io/VolcaNoseR/) (developed by Joachim Goedhart, assistant professor at SILS) to help you make such a plot using the DEG list we just saved as a `.csv` file. Alternatively, we can make one ourselves for full control of the plot:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define fold change and p-value cutoffs\nlfc_cutoff <- 1.5\npadj_cutoff <- 0.05\n\n# Make new categorical variable containing significance information\nDEGs <- DEGs %>% \n        mutate(significance = case_when(\n          padj < padj_cutoff & log2FoldChange > lfc_cutoff ~ 'Significantly upregulated',\n          padj < padj_cutoff & log2FoldChange < -lfc_cutoff ~ 'Significantly downregulated',\n          padj < padj_cutoff ~ 'Significant but small effect size',\n          TRUE ~ 'Not significant'\n        ))\n\nDEGs_subset <- DEGs %>% filter(significance == \"Significantly upregulated\" | significance == \"Significantly downregulated\")\nwrite.csv(DEGs_subset, '../data_processed/DEGs_spaceflight_vs_ground.csv', quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)\n\ncolors <- c(\"Significantly upregulated\"=\"#E69F00\", \"Significantly downregulated\"=\"#56B4E9\", \"Not significant\"=\"gray80\", \"Significant but small effect size\" = 'grey50')\n\n# select top 10 genes to highlight\ntop_genes <- DEGs[1:10, ]\n\nvolcano <- DEGs %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj), colour = significance)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 0.8) + \n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = -log10(padj_cutoff)), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lfc_cutoff), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = -lfc_cutoff), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(data = top_genes, shape = 21,fill = NA, color = \"black\") +  # Highlight top10\n  geom_text_repel(data = top_genes, aes(label = genes), size = 2, min.segment.length = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=colors) +\n  xlim(c(-10,10)) +\n  theme_bw() \n\nggsave(\"volcano_plot.png\", volcano, width = 14, height = 8, units = \"cm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 10262 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvolcano \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 10262 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-differential-gene-expression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can plot the DESeq2-normalized counts of two genes, just to confirm whether the volcano plot is correct.
