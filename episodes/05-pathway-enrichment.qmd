## Clustering and heatmaps

**TODO**:

- Add code for heatmaps of gene expression in different samples. Only show top n differential genes.
- Should we transform the (scaled) counts to Z score here?
- Also add clustering here, then extract gene lists per cluster

Read the processed data into memory:

```{R filename="R"}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyheatmaps)

variance_stabilised_counts <- read.csv('../data_processed/variance_stabilized_dataset.csv')
metadata <- read.csv("../data/samples_to_condition.csv", header = T)
DEGs <- read.csv('../data_processed/DEGs_spaceflight_vs_ground.csv', header = T)

selection <- DEGs$genes

vsc_selection <- variance_stabilised_counts %>% 
                    filter(gene %in% selection) %>%
                    pivot_longer(cols = - gene, names_to = "sample", values_to = "vst_counts") %>% 
                    merge(metadata, by.x = "sample", by.y = "sample_name") 
```

```{R filename="R"}
hm <- tidyheatmap(df = vsc_selection,
            rows = gene,
            columns = sample,
            values = vst_counts,
            scale = "row",
            annotation_col = c(condition),
            gaps_col = condition,
            cluster_rows = TRUE,
            # cluster_cols = TRUE,
            color_legend_n = 7,
            show_rownames = TRUE,
            show_colnames = FALSE
            # filename = "heatmap.pdf"
)

hm
```

## Enrichment analysis of gene lists

We want to assign some sort of funtion or pathway to a cluster / list of genes. To do this we can use GO term enrichment.

**options**:

- Do this in a webserver e.g. [g:profiler](http://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost). Seems up to date and also looks like it contains many different organisms. 
- Do this in code via clusterProfiler
